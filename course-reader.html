        <h2>Course Reader - Story Behind</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Navigating downloaded course content with various file formats can be cumbersome and inefficient.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I created an application that allows users to upload course directories and read the content smoothly using a slider interface.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Node.js, React.js</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Learning Process:</strong> This project was driven by my need to better organize and access course materials. I utilized Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend. This combination allowed me to create a responsive and efficient web application. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in file handling and asynchronous data processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Difficulties:</strong> One of the primary challenges was ensuring that the application could handle various file formats and large directory structures without performance issues. Implementing a user-friendly interface that could dynamically adjust to different types of content required significant effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Completing this project provided valuable insights into web development, particularly in terms of optimizing user experience and managing complex data structures. It was a rewarding experience that significantly improved my technical and problem-solving skills.
