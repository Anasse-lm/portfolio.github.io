        <h2>Ecommerce Website - Story Behind</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Many consumers struggle with high market prices and seek ways to purchase items directly from factories at lower prices.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I developed a collective purchasing web application that enables users to buy items directly from factories, thereby reducing costs.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, jQuery, REST API, MySQL</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Learning Process:</strong> Building this project required me to integrate several technologies and develop a comprehensive understanding of both the frontend and backend aspects of web development. I deepened my knowledge of Spring Boot for backend development and used Thymeleaf and jQuery for creating dynamic user interfaces. Working with REST APIs and MySQL helped me understand the intricacies of data fetching and management.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Difficulties:</strong> One of the main challenges was ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend. Handling asynchronous data fetching and updating the UI dynamically required careful planning and implementation. Additionally, designing a user-friendly interface that could manage complex data was a significant task.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, this project was an excellent opportunity to apply my skills in a practical context and solve a real-world problem. It also helped me appreciate the importance of a user-centric approach in web development.
